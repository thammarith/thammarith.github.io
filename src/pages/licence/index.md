#### Additional information for prints

1. The royalties for prints are 25% off from the table to support the printing industry.
2. You must send me either a physical or digital copy of the print with my work inside to claim this discount offer.

### Social media

Please do not repost my works unless you have my explicit written permission, or the work is under CC BY-SA 4.0 and you obey the licence.

For reposting, or using in other cases, the royalties would be as follow:

- For accounts/pages/&c. with under 10,000 followers/subscribers/&c., the royalties are same as the less-than-a-million-visitor tier for websites.
- For accounts/pages/&c. ≥10,000 followers/subscribers/&c., the royalties are same as the more-than-a-million-visitor tier for websites.

### Non-profit organisations

Please contact me. If it is a cause I support, I will allow free usage under conditions.

### Others

Please contact me for arrangement.

## Examples

### Case A: a single platform

Mr A wants to use two pictures of mine on his website which has 500,000 visits per year. The royalty would be $400 (2x$200) in total.

### Case B: Multiple platform

Ms B wants to use a picture from me on her website and shares on her Twitter (X) and Instagram which has 1,000,000 visits/yr, 100, and 500,000 followers respectively. She has to pay $2,000 (website) + $200 (Twitter) + $,2000 (Instagram) = $4,200 in total.
